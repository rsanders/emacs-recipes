Some Additional Emacs Recipes
=============================

Check this out into some handy directory and add it to your el-get
load path. You can do so via modifying the `el-get-recipe-path` list
the Customize facility or something like this:

    (add-to-list 'el-get-recipe-path "~/.emacs.d/emacs-recipes")
